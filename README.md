# todoapi
This one is just a quick refresh on working with Asp.net Core Web Api which uses Swagger in the UI when built in order to easily test the endpoints without having to manually enter them in the search bar or use seperate software like Postman.

Also implements a DTO model as a small example of security as it only lets the user update specific fields associated to the TodoItem model created here.
